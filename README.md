# Project Overview

This repository contains all materials related to the project, including source code, data, models, visualizations, and reports.

## Directory Structure

- `code/`  
  Contains the main analysis notebook (`code.ipynb`) for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- `data/`  
  Includes raw data, cleaned datasets, and any reference mapping files.

- `figs/`  
  Stores visual outputs and plots generated during the analysis.

- `models/`  
  Contains the best-performing trained model.

- `report/`  
  Holds the final project report and any supporting documentation.

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook at `code/code.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Execute all cells to reproduce preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation steps.
3. Generated figures and outputs will be saved to `figs/` and `results/`.
